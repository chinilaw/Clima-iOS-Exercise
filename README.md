# Clima

An exercise I learned in Udemy. Clima is a location-aware weather app. It will find out where you are in the world and query an open source weather service to retrieve the temperature and weather conditions. Also, you can change the city at the tap of a button.

What I Learned

* How to use CocoaPods to manage and use open source code libraries. 
* How to use the Command Line on Mac with Terminal.
* Learn about Networking calls.
* Use public web-based APIs to fetch data.
* How to parse data organised in JSON format.
* Learn about Core Location and utilising the iPhone’s inbuilt GPS. 
* Learn about navigation between View Controllers using Segues.
* Introduction to Delegates and Protocols.
* How to pass data between View Controllers.
* Learn and use Switch statements



## Fix for Cocoapods v1.0.1 and below

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
      config.build_settings['MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '10.10'
    end
  end
end
```

## Fix for App Transport Security Override

```XML
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
		<key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
		<dict>
			<key>openweathermap.org</key>
			<dict>
				<key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
				<true/>
				<key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
				<true/>
			</dict>
		</dict>
	</dict>
```
